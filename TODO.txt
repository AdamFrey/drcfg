At zDisconnect, use removeWatches on client for path of zref -requies dumping more of zookeeper-clj
Use more default client startup behavior (read-only flag, async return) -requires dumping more of zookeeper-clj
Overhaul startup
 * accept an existing client
 * Don't stick client into registry's metadata (blech!)
 * Scrap extra scope (just prefix w/ "drcfg", and make that a configurable default)
 * Remove `connect!` and `connect-with-wait!`
 * Let `>-` not automatically update registry (but preserve that behavior in `def>-`) -or at least offer the
   possibility of creating the drcfg stuff with a "bring your own state" option.
Move reporting to separate namespace
 * Use this to get used zrefs: echo wchp | nc 127.0.0.1 2181 | grep drcfg | sort

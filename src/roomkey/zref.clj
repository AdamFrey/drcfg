;;; A Reference type persisted in a zookeeper cluster.  The semantics are similar to a Clojure Atom
;;; with the following major differences:
;;;  * The read state (accessed via deref) may lag successful write operations (e.g. swap!)
;;;  * Read-only metadata is available which represents the zookeeper Stat data structure
;;;  * No updates are possible while disconnected
;;;  * The compare-and-set semantics are tightened to insist that updates can only apply to the
;;;    current value AND current version.
;;;  * The swap operation can fail if there is too much contention for a znode.
;;;  * Simple watcher functions are wrapped to ignore the version parameter applied to full-fledged watchers.

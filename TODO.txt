## Consolidate metadata into existing ZNode
 * It's a pain in the ass to have to create both nodes (X and X.metadata).  A tuple of [value, value-metadata, zref-metadata] would solve the problem nicely at the expense of needing a migration.
 * Scrap extra scope (just prefix w/ "drcfg", and make that a configurable default)
 * Support async calls to zookeeper lib

## Allow zref metadata to be specified in the standard Clojure `def` fashion
Existing approach (trailing varargs) is incompatible... so can't be gradually deprecated.

## Move reporting to separate namespace
 * Use this to get used zrefs: echo wchp | nc 127.0.0.1 2181 | grep drcfg | sort

;;; A proxy for a znode in a zookeeper cluster.
;;; * While offline (before the client connects) or online, a local tree can be created:
;;;   * A tree of nodes along with default (initial) values can be created locally.
;;;   * A root node must already exist before descendants can be created.
;;;   * Descendants of the root can be created in any order.  Placeholders will be created for undefined intervening nodes.
;;; * While online (after the client connects):
;;;   * A local (sub-) tree can be actualized, or persisted, to the cluster with only missing nodes (with default value) created.
;;;   * Ad hoc updates pushed from the server are streamed through the ZNode which proxies a clojure.core.async channel.
;;;     NB: if the initial/default value matches a pushed version 0 update from the server, it is not considered an "update" and is not streamed.
;;;   * The znode can subsequently be updated synchronously, but with the resulting update processed asynchronously only upon arrival.
;;;   * The compare-and-set semantics are tightened to insist that updates can only apply to the
;;;     current value AND current version.
